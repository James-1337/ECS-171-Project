This repository contains all materials for the project titled "Predicting Academic Performance from Student Lifestyle Habits", conducted for the ECS 171 course.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jayaantanaath/student-habits-vs-academic-performance 

Goal: Investigate how lifestyle habits (e.g., study hours, sleep, diet) affect student exam performance. Develop and compare multiple regression-based machine learning models to predict final exam scores.

Problem Statement: Academic success is not solely dependent on intelligence. Lifestyle behaviors—such as consistent sleep, time spent studying, and mental health—can influence outcomes. We aim to build a regression model to predict exam scores based on student habits.


We used four ML models for comparative analysis:
1. Linear Regression (Nico)
2. Polynomial Regression (Madeleine)
3. Random Forest (Shifanaaz)
4. Neural Network (James)

Each model was trained on the same preprocessed dataset and evaluated using R², MSE, and other performance metrics.
